Outlining the course

- Targeted audience (see learner profiles: New HPC users, RSE with users on HPC systems, researchers in HPC.NRW)
- Estimated length and recommended formats (e.g. X full days, X * 2 half days, in-person/online, live-coding)
- Course intentions (focus on learners perspective!):
   - Speed up research
   - Improve batch utilization through matching application requirements to requested hardware (minimal resource requirements, maximum resource utilization)
   - Convey intuition about job-sizes. What is considered large, what small?
   - Sharpen awareness for importance to avoid wasting time/energy on a shared system
   - Teach common concepts and terms of performance
   - First steps into performance optimizations (cluster-, node-, application level)
- Well defined context:
   - HPC Systems
   - Performance of jobs
   - Application performance is touched (related to job efficiency), but in-depth is outside of the scope. Next steps point towards deeper performance analyses
