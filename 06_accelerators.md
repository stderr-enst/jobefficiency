:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- What are accelerators? 
- How do they affect my jobs performance?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

After completing this episode, participants should be able to â€¦

- Understand difference of performance measurements on accelerators (GPUs, FPGAs) to CPUs.
- Understand how batch systems and performance measurements tools treat accelerators.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Introduction
Run the same example workload on GPU and compare.


:::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor
## ToDo
Don't mention FPGAs too much, maybe just a node what accelerators could be, besides GPU.
Goal is to keep it simple and accessible, focus on what's common in most HPC systems these days
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


:::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor
## ToDo
Explain how to decide where to run something. CPU vs. small GPU vs. high-end GPUs.
Touches on transfer overhead etc.
