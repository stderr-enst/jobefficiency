:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

After completing this episode, participants should be able to â€¦

- Request the right amount of resources from the scheduler.

<!-- EPISODE CONTENT HERE -->
## Starting Somewhere
Didactic path: I have no idea how many resources to ask for -> just guess and start with some combinations.
Next identify slower, or failed (OOM, timelimit) and choose the best
What does that say about efficiency?

## Requesting Resources


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints
- Don't over-/underuse resources
- Optimal time-to-solution by minimizing batch queue times and maximizing parallelism
