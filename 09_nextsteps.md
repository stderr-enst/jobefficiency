:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- What are other patterns of performance bottlenecks?
- How to evaluate an application in more detail?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

After completing this episode, participants should be able to â€¦

## Intention: Provide a roadmap learners could follow

Narrative:
- Start with picture of beautiful title slide of the talk with the snowman picture
- Next time we want to tackle the issue way in advance
- Approach our raytracing application more systematically, such that we can get the title slide done much quicker
- What could we do to dive deeper in optimizing the raytracer?
- Where can we go from here?

What we're doing here:
- Learning important programming concepts (parallel programming on many levels)
- Deeper application profiling & tools to use
