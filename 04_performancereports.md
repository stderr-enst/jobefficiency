:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- Why would I run other tools?
- Why are simple tools like `seff` and `sacct` not enough?
- Are there tools providing more information about a jobs performance?
- What steps can I take to assess a jobs performance?
- Which steps should I take first?
- Are there alternative routes I could take?
- What popular types of reports exist? (e.g. Roofline)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Develop a better understanding of alternative concepts in performance measurements.
- Introduce central terms of performance measurements and how they relate.
- Create a performance report through a third-party tool.
- Learn intentions behind performance reports (establish baseline, documentation of issues and improvements through optimization, publication of results, finding the next thread to pull in a quest for optimization)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Workflow
- Define sampling and tracing
- Describe common approaches

## Tools

## General report
- General reports show direction in which to continue
   - Specialized tools may be necessary

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints
- First things first, second things second, ...
- Profiling, tracing
- Sampling, summation
- Different HPC centers may provide different approaches to this workflow
- Performance reports offer more insight into the job and application behavior
