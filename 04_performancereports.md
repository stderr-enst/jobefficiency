:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- Why are simple tools like `seff` and `sacct` not enough?
- What steps can I take to assess a jobs performance?
- What popular types of reports exist? (e.g. Roofline)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

After completing this episode, participants should be able to â€¦

- Explain different approaches to performance measurements.
- Understand common terms and concepts in performance analyses.
- Create a performance report through a third-party tool.
- Describe what a performance report is meant for (establish baseline, documentation of issues and improvements through optimization, publication of results, finding the next thread to pull in a quest for optimization)
- Measure the performance of central components of underlying hardware (CPU, Memory, I/O, ...) (split episode?)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Workflow
- Define sampling and tracing
- Describe common approaches

## Tools

## General report
- General reports show direction in which to continue
   - Specialized tools may be necessary
